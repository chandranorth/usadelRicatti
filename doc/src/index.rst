:mod:`usadel1`: Quasiclassical equations on a 1D network
========================================================

This code solves Usadel equations in a circuit consisting of quasi-1D metallic
wires.  This is an efficient approach for modelling charge and heat transport
in mesoscopic electronic circuits made of superconducting and normal-state
metals, in the presence of a sufficient amount of impurities (dirty limit). See
:ref:`literature` for a detailed account of this approach.

The solver is written in the form of a `Python
<http://docs.python.org/>`_ module.  See :ref:`Installation instructions
<installation>` and :ref:`Scripting and usage examples <scripting>` for
getting started.
